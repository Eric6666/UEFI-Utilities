UEFI-Utilities
==============

Various (U)EFI utilities that I have developed using an early version of the GNU-EFI development library.

[March 6th 2016]  Note that the code in this repository is quite old.  Many of these utilitoes will only build against the GNU-EFI library and run under UEFI Shell v1.0.  See my UEFI-Utilities-2016 repository for utilities that will build under UDK2015 and run under UEFI Shell v2.0.
